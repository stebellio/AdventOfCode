# Advent of Code – Personal Solutions

This repository contains some of my personal solutions to various Advent of Code challenges from different years.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**:  
- The solutions are partial — not all days are completed.
- Some solutions (especially recent ones) may not work correctly or may lack proper refactoring.
- This repository is intended as a sandbox for problem solving and language exploration.

## Purpose

The main goals of this repo are:
- Practicing algorithmic thinking and optimization
- Testing features of the programming language
- Experimenting with different coding patterns and functional approaches

## Structure

- Organized by year/day
- Solutions written in JS/TS

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Complete missing days
- [ ] Refactor older or messy solutions
- [ ] Add test coverage where missing
- [ ] Write performance benchmarks for selected problems

## Note

This is **not meant to represent production-quality code**, but rather to reflect exploratory coding during spare time.
